# Node-read

Get Readable Content from any page. Based on Arc90's readability project.

## Features

1. Blazingly Fast. This project is based on Cheerio engine, which is 8x times faster than JSDOM.

## Why not Node-readability

Before starting this project I used Node-readability, but the dependencies of that project plus the slowness of JSDOM made it very frustrating for me to work with it. So I decided to write my own version of Arc90's Readability using the fast Cheerio engine with the least number of dependencies.
